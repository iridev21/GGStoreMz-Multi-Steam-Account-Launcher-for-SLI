# GGStoreMz-Multi-Steam-Account-Launcher-for-SLI
Safe Steam Dual Account Launcher to have 2 independent accounts in a same computer, this avoid their files and processes to being crossed.

Prerequisites: Have two Steam installations on your pc, having their directories with 2 different names.

Important: I developed this for a Games Store as a work but they authorized me to make it public in order their users coulkd verify the security and integrity of the program, thats why it has 'GGStoreMz' in the name and in some buttons or functions. Feel free to change that to another names you want, but if you are going to redistribute it at least give me some credits, please, thanks.
